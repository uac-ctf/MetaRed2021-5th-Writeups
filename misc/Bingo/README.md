# Bingo

## Description

Every year we decide who receives the best student award in the master of cybersecurity by playing bingo. Do you want to try?

**Solve**

This challenge presents a web page where you can play a diferent kind of bingo, after analysing the source code
we can understand 2 diferent endpoints /generate and /check

After some basic requests we can see that /generate returns a number and that check let's us check if a guess is the last number generated.

With the information on the web page it seems that we need to guess 10 numbers in a row, no way this can be done just by guessing or brute force.

This is where the randcrack module comes in https://github.com/tna0y/Python-random-module-cracker

This module let's us input numbers generated by a random number renerator in python and after 624 numbers it can guess the next ones.

This small python codes exemplifies the solution

```
import random, time
import requests
from randcrack import RandCrack

random.seed(time.time())

rc = RandCrack()
s = requests.Session()

for i in range(624):
    data = {"attempt": "191919199"}
    url = "http://localhost:80/generate"
    response = s.get(url)
    url = "http://localhost:80/check"
    response = s.post(url,json=data)
    print("Result: {}".format(response.json()))
    rc.submit(int(response.json()['ANSWER']))

for i in range(10):
    data = {"attempt": rc.predict_randrange(0, 4294967295)}
    url = "http://localhost:80/generate"
    response = s.get(url)
    url = "http://localhost:80/check"
    response = s.post(url,json=data)
    print("Result: {}".format(response.json()))
```
