## Description

A student was stalking the teacher from eletronic classes every day during 6 weeks. This student recorded the coordinates where he found this teacher in each day. After some time analysing these places, the student found the teachers secret. The flag is CTFUA{secret}


## Solve

Each week (7 days) represent a character, and each day contains 2 coordinates or none. This can be addressed using a 7 segment display to draw each character (day 1: segment A, day 2: segment B, etc, see this link: https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/seven-segment_display/representing_letters)
