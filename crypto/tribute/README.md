**DESCRIPTION**
```
After watching a TV Show you went to have lunch at "100 Montaditos" and you found this menu, what will you do?
```

**SOLVE**
```
This is a tribute to the Mr Robot TV Show, [inspiration source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9CBKGLVCME).

The numbers provided on the robots.txt file should be directly substituted by the corresponding alphabet letter: 1 -> a, 2-> b, ...

Given the string from this process you have to Rot-13 it.

After introducing spaces into the resulting sentence you have something like: the numbers will help you find your calling but dont be duped cut down the woods they be erdos

Now go to the menu (flag.jpeg) and you have to remove the **MENU ITEMS** which are from the [Erdos-Woods number sequence](https://oeis.org/A059756)

Now, after removing those numbers, collect the numbers in **RED** color, which results in: 43 54 46 55 41 7b 39 33 30 31 39 32 37 7d

Decoding (without spaces) from hex you get the flag.
